        "abstract": "This study examines the factors influencing user acceptance of ChatGPT as a daily reference tool and assesses varying levels of user awareness. It aims to offer valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges of implementing ChatGPT in an educational context. To achieve this objective, we employ an integrated model comprising the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and four novel external constructs: Privacy, Security, Social Influence, and Trust. This proposed model delivers an in-depth understanding of user acceptance by simultaneously measuring diverse user perspectives. Adopting a quantitative research approach, the study surveys undergraduate students regarding their use of ChatGPT. The results contribute to bridging the gap between technology and users, shedding light on users' actual experiences and considerations regarding AI-based tools. Specifically, the study is expected to reveal the significant influence of external factors on user acceptance of ChatGPT and to provide a set of recommendations for educational institutions, policymakers, and developers. This study aids the developers of ChatGPT and similar technologies by offering insights into how to design and enhance more user-friendly and secure systems that better meet users' needs and expectations.",

        "abstract": "Chatbots are mainly text-based conversational agents that simulate conversations with users. This study aims to investigate drivers of users` satisfaction and continuance intention toward chatbot-based customer service. We propose an analytical framework combining the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), information system success (ISS) model, TAM, and the need for interaction with a service employee (NFI-SE). Analysis of data collected from 370 actual chatbot users reveals that information quality (IQ) and service quality (SQ) positively influence consumers` satisfaction, and that perceived enjoyment (PE), perceived usefulness (PU), and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significant predictors of continuance intention (CI). The need for interaction with an employee moderates the effects of PEOU and PU on satisfaction. The findings also revealed that satisfaction with chatbot e-service is a strong determinant and predictor of users` CI toward chatbots. Thus, chatbots should enhance their information and service quality to increase users` satisfaction. The findings imply that digital technologies services, such as chatbots, could be combined with human service employees to satisfy digital users.",

During a nine-month period, the author conducted 40 interviews and 2 focus groups. An analysis of data gathered led to two significant initial findings: (1) current discourse on Explainable AI is hindered by a lack of consistent terminology; and (2) there are multiple distinct use cases for Explainable AI, including: debugging models, understanding bias, and building trust. These uses cases assume different user personas, will likely require different explanation strategies, and are not evenly addressed by current XAI tools. This stakeholder research supports a broad characterization of the problem of Explainable AI and can provide important context to inform the design of future capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Background ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has gained popularity for its ability to generate human-like responses. It is essential to note that overreliance or blind trust in ChatGPT, especially in high-stakes decision-making contexts, can have severe consequences. Similarly, lacking trust in the technology can lead to underuse, resulting in missed opportunities. Objective This study investigated the impact of users\u2019 trust in ChatGPT on their intent and actual use of the technology. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) users\u2019 intent to use ChatGPT increases with their trust in the technology; (2) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users\u2019 intent to use the technology; (3) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users\u2019 trust in the technology; and (4) users\u2019 intent to use ChatGPT can partially mediate the effect of trust in the technology on its actual use. Methods This study distributed a web-based survey to adults in the United States who actively use ChatGPT (version 3.5) at least once a month between February 2023 through March 2023. The survey responses were used to develop 2 latent constructs: Trust and Intent to Use, with Actual Use being the outcome variable. The study used partial least squares structural equation modeling to evaluate and test the structural model and hypotheses. Results In the study, 607 respondents completed the survey. The primary uses of ChatGPT were for information gathering (n",

        "abstract": "The introduction of the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT by OpenAI has sparked much interest and debate among academic researchers. Commentators from different scientific disciplines have raised many concerns and issues, especially related to the ethics of using these tools in scientific writing and publications. In addition, there has been discussions about whether ChatGPT is trustworthy, effective, and useful in increasing researchers\u2019 productivity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate ChatGPT\u2019s performance on tasks related to bibliometric analysis, by comparing the output provided by the chatbot with a recently conducted bibliometric study on the same topic. The findings show that there are large discrepancies and ChatGPT\u2019s trustworthiness is low in this particular area. Therefore, researchers should exercise caution when using ChatGPT as a tool in bibliometric studies.",

        "abstract": "Today, the use of chatbots for different functions in various industries has become a very interesting business for companies. Chatbots are promising types of interfaces. It is therefore necessary to understand how customers interact with retailers' interfaces in order to provide them with a better experience. In this study, we mobilise two theories, such as Stimilus-Organism-Response and Social Presence Theory, to formulate our research hypotheses. We have made major contributions to the interactive marketing and artificial intelligence literature by focusing on an emerging interactive technology: text chatbots. Our aim is to test the hedonic attributes of consumer trust in text chatbots by integrating the social and emotional aspects of this interaction. We also want to look at the moderating effects of text chatbot disclosure and task complexity. Based on the responses, we ran a questionnaire survey. A total of 353 people were polled for data. Participants were chosen at random. The structural equation modelling technique was used. First, the findings revealed that empathy and friendliness are major hedonic predictors of consumers' confidence in text chatbots. Second, the results demonstrate that the chatbot's task complexity and disclosure partially affect the empathy-trust relationship and the usability-trust relationship. We have made significant contributions to the field of interactive marketing research and artificial intelligence by focusing on new interactive technologies such as text-based chatbots. Our study is one of the first to look at the hedonic determinants of customer belief in text-based chatbots (1). All previous research has concentrated on the practical application of chatbots for digital customer service. The moderating effects of human-chatbot contact are investigated in our study (2). These two contributions make our research original. The findings give additional information that e-service providers and chatbot developers may utilise to improve their services, understand their effects on user experience, and provide a guide for strategy development and relationship building.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has revolutionized how we interact with information and entertainment, with ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, being among its prominent applications. However, knowledge regarding the psychological impact of interacting with ChatGPT is limited. This study investigated the relationships between trust in ChatGPT; ChatGPT\u2019s user perceptions; perceived stereotyping by ChatGPT; and two psychological outcomes, namely, psychological well-being and self-esteem. This study hypothesized that the former three variables exhibit a positive direct relationship with self-esteem. Additionally, the study proposed that job anxiety moderates the associations among trust in ChatGPT, user perceptions of ChatGPT, and psychological well-being. Using a survey design, data were collected from 732 participants and analyzed using SEM and SmartPLS analysis. Notably, perceived stereotyping by ChatGPT significantly predicted self-esteem, while user perceptions of ChatGPT and trust in ChatGPT exhibited a positive direct relationship with self-esteem. Additionally, job anxiety moderated the relationship between ChatGPT\u2019s user perceptions and psychological well-being. These results provide important insights into the psychological effects of interacting with AI technology and highlight job anxiety\u2019s role in moderating these effects. This study\u2019s findings have implications for developing and using AI technology in various fields, including mental health and human-robot interactions.",
